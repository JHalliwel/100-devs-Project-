As my 100 devs project here is my idea 

i'm a huge Harry potter fan i was thinking of making like a community of Harry potter
theme houses you will get to live in a house based on either Harry potter, weasleys etc

this will be a immensive community where i will have market like you were inside the diagon 
alley 

as far as the technical aspect i was thinking on contructing a page enumerating the features of 
this community and having a application where people can apply to live on the community
